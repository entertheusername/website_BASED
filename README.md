### Troubleshooting

1. If encountering issues related to missing modules, ensure `requirements.txt` is fully installed without errors.
   * Potential root cause: Multiple Python versions are installed on the same machine, and the IDE might be running with a different Python interpreter where the modules aren't installed.
   * Solution:
     1. Verify the list of modules installed in the current python intepreter by running:
        
        ```bash
        python -m pip list
        ```
     
     3. Verify the current Python version by running:
        
        ```bash
        python --version
        ```
     5. For **VSC**, use the command palette (Ctrl + Shift + P) → `Python: Select Interpreter` to change the inteperter.
     6. FOR **PyCharm**, go to *Settings* → *Project: \[Your Project]* → *Python Interpreter* to change the interpreter.
        
2. If WampServer is not working properly, verify that no other services are using port 80 or 3306.
